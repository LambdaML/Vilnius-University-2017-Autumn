# Coding Theory Homework

## Week 3 (Section 1.9 - 1.10)

### Exercise 1.9.5

> |*M*| = 2, *n* = 3, and *C* = {001, 101}. If *v* = 001 is sent, when will **IMLD** conclude this correctly, and when will **IMLD** incorrectly conclude that 101 was sent?

### Exercise 1.9.6

> Let |*M*| = 3 and *n* = 3. For each word *w* in *K*<sup>3</sup> that could be received, find the word *v* in de code *C* = {000, 001, 110} which **IMLD** will conclude was sent.


### Exercise 1.9.7

> Construct the IMLD table for each of the following codes.

> (b) *C* = {000, 001, 010, 011}

### Exercise 1.10.2

> Suppose *p* = .90, |*M*| = 2, *n* = 3, *C* = {001, 101}, as in Exercise 1.9.5.

> (b) If *v* = 101 is sent, find the probability that **IMLD** will correctly conclude this after one transmission.

### Exercise 1.10.4

> Suppose *p* = .90 and *C* = {000, 001, 110}, as in Exercise 1.9.6. If *v* = 110 is sent, find the probability that IMLD will correctly conclude this, and the probability that IMLD will incorrectly conclude that 000 was sent.


### Exercise 1.10.5

> For each of the following codes *C* calculate *Î¦*<sub>*p*</sub>(*C*, *v*) for each *v* in *C* using *p* = .90. (The **IMLD** tables for these codes were constructed in Exercise 1.9.7).

> (b) *C* = {000, 001, 010, 011}
