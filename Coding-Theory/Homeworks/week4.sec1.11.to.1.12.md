# Coding Theory Homework

## Week 4 (Section 1.11 - 1.12)

### Exercise 1.11.2

> Let *C* = {001, 101, 110}. Determine whether *C* will detect the error patterns

> (a) 011
> (b) 001
> (c) 000.


### Exercise 1.11.4

> Which eror patterns will the code *C* = *K*<sup>*n*</sup> detect?

### Exercise 1.11.5

> (i) Let *C* be a code contains the zero word aas a codeword. Prove that if the eror pattern *u* is a codeword, then *C* will not detect *u*.

> (ii) Prove that n code will detect the zero eror pattern *u* = 0.

### Exercise 1.11.7

> Determine the eror patterns dereected by each code in **Exercise 1.9.7** by using the **IMLD** tables constructed there

> ### Exercise 1.9.7

> Construct the IMLD table for each of the following codes.

> (b) *C* = {000, 001, 010, 011}


### Exercise 1.11.10b

> Find the eror patterns detected by each following codes and compare your answers with those **Exercise 1.11.7**.

> (b) *C* = {000, 001, 010, 011}

### Exercise 1.11.12

> Find the distance of each of following codes.

> (b) *C* = {000, 001, 010, 011}
> (e) *C* = {00000, 11111}
> (f) *C* = {00000, 11100, 00111, 11011}
> (g) *C* = {00000, 11110, 01111, 10001}

### Exercise 1.11.13

> Find the distance of code formed by adding a parity check digit to *K*<sup>*n*</sup>.

### Exercise 1.11.19

> For each code in *C* in **Exercise 1.11.12** find the eror patterns which **Theorem 1.11.14** guarantees *C* will detect.

> (b) *C* = {000, 001, 010, 011}
> (e) *C* = {00000, 11111}
> (f) *C* = {00000, 11100, 00111, 11011}
> (g) *C* = {00000, 11110, 01111, 10001}

### Exercise 1.11.20

> Let *C* be the code consisting of all words of length 4 which have even weight. Find the error pattern *C* detects.

### Exercise 1.12.5

> Let *C* = {001, 101, 110}. Does *C* correct the error pattern *u* = 010? What about *u* = 000?

### Exercise 1.12.7

### Exercise 1.12.8

### Exercise  1.12.12i:b

### Exercise 1.12.12ii:b,e,f,g

### Exercise 1.12.14b,e,f,g
