## Week 7 (Section 2.5 - 2.6)

### Exercise 2.5.3a,b,c,f

> Use **Algorithm 2.5.1** to find a basis for *C* = < *S* > for each of the following sets *S*.

> (a) *S* = {010,011,111}

> (b) *S* = {1010,0101,1111}

> (c)	*S* = {0101,1010,1100}

> (f)	*S* = {10101,01010,11111,00011,10110}.

### Exercise 2.5.6a,b,c,f

> Use **Algorithm 2.5.4** to find a basis for *C* = < *S* > for each set *S* in **Exercise 2.5.3** and compare answers.

> (a) *S* = {010,011,111}

> (b) *S* = {1010,0101,1111}

> (c)	*S* = {0101,1010,1100}

> (f)	*S* = {10101,01010,11111,00011,10110}.

### Exercise 2.5.10a,b,c,f

> Use Algorithm 2.5. 7 to find a basis for Cl. for each of the codes *C* =< *S* > where

> (a) *S* = {010,011,111}

> (b) *S* = {1010,0101,1111}

> (c)	*S* = {0101,1010,1100}

> (f)	*S* = {10101,01010,11111,00011,10110}.

### Exercise 2.6.4 (only A)

> Determine whether each of the following is a generator matrix for some linear code. 
```
    | 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 | 
A = | 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 | 
    | 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 | 
    | 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 | 
```

### Exercise 2.6.5d

> Find a generator matrix in RREF for each of the following codes.

> (d) C = {00000, 11100, 00111, 11011}.

### Exercise 2.6.10b

> For each of the following generating matrices, encode the given messages.
``` 
    | 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 |  
B = | 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 |  
    | 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 |  
```

### Exercise 2.6.12a,b

> Let C be the code with generator matrix
```
    | 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 |  
G = | 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 |  
    | 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 |  
    | 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 |  
```

> Assign messages to the words in *K*<sup>4</sup> as follows:
```
A = 0000    B = 1000    C = 0100    D = 0010  
E = 0001    F = 1100    G = 1010    H = 1001  
I = 0110    J = 0101    K = 0011    L = 1110  
M = 1101    N = 1011    O = 0111    P = 1111  
```
> (a) Encode the message HELP.

> (b) Transmit the message HELP assuming that during transmission the first word receives an error in the first position, the second word receives no errors, the third an error in the seventh position, and the fourth an error in the fifth and sixth positions.

### Exercise 2.6.13 (only for 2.6.5d)

> Find the number of messages which can be sent, and the information rate *r*, for each of the linear codes in **Exercises 2.6.5**.

> (d) C = {00000, 11100, 00111, 11011}.
