## Week 6 (Section 2.3 - 2.4)

### Exercise 2.3.4

> Test each of the following sets for linear independence. If the set is linearly dependent, extract from *S* a largest linearly independent subset.

> (c) *S* = {1101, 0111, 1100, 0011}

> (f) *S* = {1100, 1010, 1001, 0101}

#### For (c) *S* = {1101, 0111, 1100, 0011}.

```

a(1101) + b(0111) + c(1100) + d(0011) = 0000

a.1 + b.0 + c.1 + d.0   = a + c         = 0
a.1 + b.1 + c.1 + d.0   = a + b + c     = 0
a.0 + b.1 + c.0 + d.1   = b + d         = 0
a.1 + b.1 + c.0 + d.1   = a + b + d     = 0

b + d           = 0
a + b + d       = 0
a + 0           = 0
a               = 0

a + c           = 0
0 + c           = 0
c               = 0

a + b + c       = 0
0 + b + 0       = 0
b               = 0

b + d           = 0
0 + d           = 0
d               = 0

a = b = c = d   = 0

```

*S* is linearly independent.

#### For (f) *S* = {1100, 1010, 1001, 0101}.

```

a(1100) + b(1010) + c(1001) + d(0101) = 00000

a.1 + b.1 + c.1 + d.0   = a + b + c     = 0
a.1 + b.0 + c.0 + d.1   = a + d         = 0
a.0 + b.1 + c.0 + d.0   = b             = 0
a.0 + b.0 + c.1 + d.1   = c + d         = 0

b               = 0
a + b + c       = 0
a + 0 + c       = 0
a + c           = 0
a               = c

a + d           = 0
a               = d

a = c = d       = 1 (?or 0?)

b               = 0

```

```

1(1100) + 0(1010) + 1(1001) + 1(0101) = 00000

We will discard '1(0101)'. Because it is closest (first) dependent word to 00000. (Right to left).

a(1100) + b(1010) + c(1001) = 00000

a.1 + b.1 + c.1         = a + b + c     = 0 
a.1 + b.0 + c.0         = a             = 0
a.0 + b.1 + c.0         = b             = 0
a.0 + b.0 + c.1         = c             = 0

a               = 0
b               = 0
c               = 0

a = b = c       = 0

```

The new *S'* is linearly independent.

### Exercise 2.3.7

> For each set in **Exercise 2.2.3** find a basis *B* for the code *C* = < *S* > and a basis *B*<sup>⊥</sup> for the dual code *C*<sup>⊥</sup>.

> (a) *S* = {010, 011, 111}  
> (a) *C*<sup>⊥</sup> = {000}

> (b) *S* = {1010, 0101, 1111}  
> (b) *C*<sup>⊥</sup> = {0000, 1010, 0101, 1111)

> (c) *S* = {0101, 1010, 1100}  
> (c) *C*<sup>⊥</sup> = {0000, 1111)

> (f) *S* = {10101, 01010, 11111, 00011, 10110}  
> (f) *C*<sup>⊥</sup> = {10100, 00000, 11011, 01111}

#### For (a) *C*<sup>⊥</sup> = {000}

#### For (b) *C*<sup>⊥</sup> = {0000, 1010, 0101, 1111)

#### For (c) *C*<sup>⊥</sup> = {0000, 1111)

#### For (f) *C*<sup>⊥</sup> = {10100, 00000, 11011, 01111}

### Exercise 2.3.8a,b,c,f

> Find the dimensions of each code *C* = < *S* > and its dual *C*<sup>⊥</sup>. in **Exercise 2.2.3** (see also **Exercise 2.7.7).

> (a) *S* = {010, 011, 111}

> (b) *S* = {1010, 0101, 1111}

> (c) *S* = {0101, 1010, 1100}

> (f) *S* = {10101, 01010, 11111, 00011, 10110}

### Exercise 2.3.10b,e

> Write each of the following words in *K*<sup>4</sup> as a unique linear combination of the words in the basis {1000, 1100, 1110, 1111}:

> (b) 1010

> (e) 0000.

### Exercise 2.3.12a

> (a) Find the basis for *K*<sup>4</sup> which contains {1001, 1111}.

### Exercise 2.3.15a,b,c,f

> Check your answers in **Exercise 2.3.8** with the equation in **Theorem 2.3.14**.

> (a) *S* = {010, 011, 111}

> (b) *S* = {1010, 0101, 1111}

> (c) *S* = {0101, 1010, 1100}

> (f) *S* = {10101, 01010, 11111, 00011, 10110}

#### Theorem 2.3.14 

> Let *C* = < *S* > be the linear code generated by a subset *S* of *K*<sup>*n*</sup>. Then (dimension of *C*) + (dimension of C<sup>⊥</sup>) = *n*.

### Exercise 2.3.17

> Let *S* be a subset of *K*<sup>8</sup> and assume that {11110000, 00001111, 10000001} is a basis for *C*<sup>⊥</sup>. Find the number of words in *C* = <*S*>.


### Exercise 2.3.18 (there must be "S⊥ have" in place of "S have")

> **Theorem 2.3.14** also holds in *R*<sup>*n*</sup>. In *R*<sup>*n*</sup> every vector can be written uniquely as the sum of a vector in <*S*> and a vector in *S*<sup>⊥</sup>, and the zero vector is the only vector <*S*> and *S*<sup>⊥</sup> have in commmon. (For example in *R*<sup>3</sup> take <*S*> to be the xy-plane and *S*<sup>⊥</sup> the z-axis). Use *S* = {000, 101} in *K*<sup>3</sup> to show that this is not the case in general in *K*<sup>*n*</sup>.

#### Theorem 2.3.14 

> Let *C* = < *S* > be the linear code generated by a subset *S* of *K*<sup>*n*</sup>. Then (dimension of *C*) + (dimension of C<sup>⊥</sup>) = *n*.

### Exercise 2.3.23b

> Find the number of different bases for each code *C* = <*S*> for

> (b) *S* = {1010, 0101, 1111}.

### Exercise 2.4.1(only BC)

> Find the product of each pair of the following matrices ehenever the product is defined.
```
    | 0 1 0 1 |         | 1 1 0 1 1 0 |
B = | 1 0 0 1 |     C = | 0 1 1 0 1 1 |
    | 1 1 0 0 |         | 1 0 1 1 0 1 |
                        | 1 0 1 0 1 1 |
```

### Exercise 2.4.2

> Find the 2 x 2 matrices *A* and *B* over *K* such that *AB* ≠ *BA*.


### Exercise 2.4.3

> Find 2 x 2 matrices *A* and *B* over *K*, both different from the zero matrix 0, suxh that *AB* = 0.

### Exercise 2.4.4 (you must find nonzero matrices)

> Find 2 x 2 matricies *A*, *B*, and *C* over *K* such that *AB* = *AC* but *B* ≠ *C*.

### Exercise 2.4.6 (only D)

> Find the RREF for each of the four matrices in **Exercise 2.4.1**.
```
    | 1 1 1 1 |  
D = | 0 1 0 1 |  
    | 1 0 1 0 |  
    | 1 1 0 1 |  
```
