# Coding Theory Homework

## Week 6 (Section 2.3 - 2.4)

### Exercise 2.3.4c,f,

> Test each of the following sets for linear independence. If the set is linearly dependent, extract from S a largest linearly independent subset.

> (c) *S* = {1101, 0111, 1100, 0011}

> (f) *S* = {1100, 1010, 1001, 0101}

### Exercise 2.3.7a,b,c,f (the dual code was computed in Exercise 2.2.7)

> For each set in **Exercise 2.2.3** find a basis *B* for the code *C* = <*S*> and a basis *B*<sup>⊥</sup> for the dual code *C*<sup>⊥</sup>.

> (a) *S* = {010, 011, 111}

> (b) *S* = {1010, 0101, 1111}

> (c) *S* = {0101, 1010, 1100}

> (f) *S* = {10101, 01010, 11111, 00011, 10110}

### Exercise 2.3.8a,b,c,f

> Find the dimensions of each code *C* = <*S*> and its dual *C*<sup>⊥</sup>. in **Exercise 2.2.3** (see also **Exercise 2.7.7).

> (a) *S* = {010, 011, 111}

> (b) *S* = {1010, 0101, 1111}

> (c) *S* = {0101, 1010, 1100}

> (f) *S* = {10101, 01010, 11111, 00011, 10110}

### Exercise 2.3.10b,e

> Write each of the following words in *K*<sup>4</sup> as a unique linear combination of the words in the basis {1000, 1100, 1110, 1111}:

> (b) 1010

> (e) 0000.

### Exercise 2.3.12a

> (a) Find the basis for *K*<sup>4</sup> which contains {1001, 1111}.

### Exercise 2.3.15a,b,c,f

> Check your answers in **Exercise 2.3.8** with the equation in **Theorem 2.3.14**.

> (a) *S* = {010, 011, 111}

> (b) *S* = {1010, 0101, 1111}

> (c) *S* = {0101, 1010, 1100}

> (f) *S* = {10101, 01010, 11111, 00011, 10110}
