# Coding Theory Homework

## Week 6 (Section 2.3 - 2.4)

### Exercise 2.3.4c,f,

> Test each of the following sets for linear independence. If the set is linearly dependent, extract from S a largest linearly independent subset.

> (c) *S* = {1101, 0111, 1100, 0011}

> (f) *S* = {1100, 1010, 1001, 0101}

### Exercise 2.3.7a,b,c,f (the dual code was computed in Exercise 2.2.7)

> For each set in **Exercise 2.2.3** find a basis *B* for the code *C* = <*S*> and a basis *B*<sup>⊥</sup> for the dual code *C*<sup>⊥</sup>.

> (a) *S* = {010, 011, 111}

> (b) *S* = {1010, 0101, 1111}

> (c) *S* = {0101, 1010, 1100}

> (f) *S* = {10101, 01010, 11111, 00011, 10110}

### Exercise 2.3.8a,b,c,f

> Find the dimensions of each code *C* = <*S*> and its dual *C*<sup>⊥</sup>. in **Exercise 2.2.3** (see also **Exercise 2.7.7).

> (a) *S* = {010, 011, 111}

> (b) *S* = {1010, 0101, 1111}

> (c) *S* = {0101, 1010, 1100}

> (f) *S* = {10101, 01010, 11111, 00011, 10110}

### Exercise 2.3.10b,e

> Write each of the following words in *K*<sup>4</sup> as a unique linear combination of the words in the basis {1000, 1100, 1110, 1111}:

> (b) 1010

> (e) 0000.

### Exercise 2.3.12a

> (a) Find the basis for *K*<sup>4</sup> which contains {1001, 1111}.

### Exercise 2.3.15a,b,c,f

> Check your answers in **Exercise 2.3.8** with the equation in **Theorem 2.3.14**.

> (a) *S* = {010, 011, 111}

> (b) *S* = {1010, 0101, 1111}

> (c) *S* = {0101, 1010, 1100}

> (f) *S* = {10101, 01010, 11111, 00011, 10110}

### Exercise 2.3.17

> Let *S* be a subset of *K*<sup>8</sup> and assume that {11110000, 00001111, 10000001} is a basis for *C*<sup>⊥</sup>. Find the number of words in *C* = <*S*>.


### Exercise 2.3.18 (there must be "S⊥ have" in place of "S have")

> **Theorem 2.3.14** also holds in *R*<sup>*n*</sup>. In *R*<sup>*n*</sup> every vector can be written uniquely as the sum of a vector in <*S*> and a vector in *S*<sup>⊥</sup>, and the zero vector is the only vector <*S*> and *S*<sup>⊥</sup> have in commmon. (For example in *R*<sup>3</sup> take <*S*> to be the xy-plane and *S*<sup>⊥</sup> the z-axis). Use *S* = {000, 101} in *K*<sup>3</sup> to show that this is not the case in general in *K*<sup>*n*</sup>.

### Exercise 2.3.23b

> Find the number of different bases for each code *C* = <*S*> for

> (b) *S* = {1010, 0101, 1111}.

### Exercise 2.4.1(only BC)

> Find the product of each pair of the following matrices ehenever the product is defined.

### Exercise 2.4.2

> Find the 2 x 2 matrices *A* and *B* over *K* such that *AB* ≠ *BA*.

### Exercise 2.4.3

> Find 2 x 2 matrices *A* and *B* over *K*, both different from the zero matrix 0, suxh that *AB* = 0.

### Exercise 2.4.4 (you must find nonzero matrices)

> Find 2 x 2 matricies *A*, *B*, and *C* over *K* such that *AB* = *AC* but *B* ≠ *C*.

### Exercise 2.4.6 (only D)

> Find the RREF for each of the four matrices in **Exercise 2.4.1*.
