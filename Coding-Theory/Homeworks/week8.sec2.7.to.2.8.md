# Coding Theory Homework

## Week 8 (Section 2.7 - 2.8)

### Exercise 2.7.4d (the generating matrix was constructed in Exercise 2.6.5)

> Find a parity-check matrix from each of the following codes.

> (d)	C = {00000, 11100, 00111, 11011}

### Exercise 2.7.9b

> In each part, a parity-check matrix for linear code *C* for is given. Find 

>(i) a generator matrix for *C*<sup>⊥</sup>; 

>(ii) a generator matrix for *C*.

```

    | 0 1 |
    | 1 0 |
H = | 0 1 | 
    | 1 0 |
    | 0 1 |

```

### Exercise 2.7.11b

> For each code *C* described below, find the dimension of *C*, the dimension of *C*<sup>⊥</sup>, the size of the generating and parity-check matrices for *C* and for *C*<sup>⊥</sup>, the number of words in *C* and in *C*<sup>⊥</sup>, and the information rates *r* or *C* and *C*<sup>⊥</sup>.

> (b) *C* has length *n* = 23 and dimension 11.
