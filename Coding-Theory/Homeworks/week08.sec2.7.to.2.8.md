## Week 8 (Section 2.7 - 2.8)

### Exercise 2.7.4d (the generating matrix was constructed in Exercise 2.6.5)

> Find a parity-check matrix from each of the following codes.

> (d)	C = {00000, 11100, 00111, 11011}

### Exercise 2.7.9b

> In each part, a parity-check matrix for linear code *C* for is given. Find 

>(i) a generator matrix for *C*<sup>⊥</sup>; 

>(ii) a generator matrix for *C*.

```

    | 0 1 |
    | 1 0 |
H = | 0 1 |
    | 1 0 |
    | 0 1 |

```

### Exercise 2.7.11b

> For each code *C* described below, find the dimension of *C*, the dimension of *C*<sup>⊥</sup>, the size of the generating and parity-check matrices for *C* and for *C*<sup>⊥</sup>, the number of words in *C* and in *C*<sup>⊥</sup>, and the information rates *r* or *C* and *C*<sup>⊥</sup>.

> (b) *C* has length *n* = 23 and dimension 11.

### Exercise 2.8.1

> Find the other five generator matrices for the code generated by 

```

    | 0 0 1 |

```

### Exercise 2.8.4b

> Let *C* be the generator matrix in **Example 2.8.3.** Encode each of the following messages *u*, and observe that the first 4 digits in the resulting codeword form the message *u*.

> (b) *u* = 1011

### Exercise 2.8.5

> Explain a method for recovering *u* from *uG* if *G* is not in standard form.

### Exercise 2.8.6

> If a linear code *C* has generator matrix 

```

    | 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 |
    | 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 |
G = | 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 |
    | 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 |
    | 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 |

```

> recover *u* from *v* = *uG* = 0000101.

### Exercise 2.8.10b

> Find a systematic code *C'* equivalent to the given code *C*. Check that *C* and *C'* have the same length, dimension, and distance.

> (b) *C* = {00000, 11100, 00111, 11011}.


### Exercise 2.8.11b

> Find a generator matrix *G* in standard form for a code equivalent to the code with given generator matrix *G*.

```

    | 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 |
G = | 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 |
    | 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 |

```
### Exercise 2.8.12a

> Find a generator matrix *G'* in standard form for a code *C'* equivalent o the code *C* with given parity-check matrix H.

```

    | 1 1 0 |
    | 1 0 0 |
H = | 0 1 1 |
    | 0 1 0 |
    | 0 0 1 |

```

### Exercise 2.8.14

> Determine whether each of the following pairs of matrices *G*<sub>1</sub> and *G*<sub>2</sub> generate equivalent codes.


```

     | 0 0 0 0 1 1 |           | 0 0 1 0 0 1 |

```

```

(c)

     | 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 |           | 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 |
